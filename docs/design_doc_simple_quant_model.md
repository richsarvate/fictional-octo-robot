# Simple Quant Stock Picker - Mean Reversion

## The Idea
Use math to pick stocks in the S&P 500. When stock prices deviate too far from their average, bet on them returning to normal.

Inspired by Renaissance Technologies' mean reversion strategies, but ultra-simplified.

## The Strategy

**Single Signal: Mean Reversion**

Buy when a stock's price drops below its 20-day average. Sell when it rises above.

```python
# Calculate 20-day moving average
price_ma20 = close.rolling(20).mean()

# Calculate deviation from average
deviation = (close - price_ma20) / price_ma20

# Smooth over 5 days and invert (negative deviation = buy signal)
signal = -deviation.rolling(5).mean()

# Normalize to z-score for position sizing
signal_zscore = (signal - signal.rolling(252).mean()) / signal.rolling(252).std()
```

**Why this works:**
- Markets overreact to short-term news
- Prices oscillate around fair value
- Mean reversion is one of the most reliable patterns in finance

## Portfolio Rules

- **Universe**: S&P 500, $1B+ market cap (~400 stocks)
- **Position Size**: 0.1% - 2% per stock (based on signal strength)
- **Rebalance**: Weekly (every Monday)
- **Limits**: Max 25% per sector, max 15% drawdown â†’ stop trading

**Position Sizing:**
```python
base_weight = 1 / num_stocks  # Equal weight starting point
position = base_weight * (1 + signal_zscore / 2)  # Adjust by signal
position = clip(position, 0.001, 0.02)  # Apply 0.1% - 2% limits
```

## Expected Returns

- **Annual Return**: 10-14% (vs S&P 500 ~10%)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.6-1.0
- **Max Loss**: ~12%
- **Win Rate**: 60-65% of trades

Note: Single signal = more conservative than multi-signal approaches

## Build Plan

1. Get daily price/volume data (Yahoo Finance)
2. Code mean reversion signal
3. Build portfolio logic with constraints
4. Backtest 2010-2025 + optimize parameters

## How to Use

**Weekly Routine (Every Monday):**
